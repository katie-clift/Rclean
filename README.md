Rclean
======

This code was developed for the Course Project of the JHU MOOC called Getting and Cleaning Data.  Per the project requirements, there is one R script called **run_analysis.R** that does the following: 

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
